   This is the webpage for the `Imperial College London Mathematics
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/maths>`__  module MATH60022/MATH70022 Finite
   Elements: numerical analysis and implementation. There's an introductory
   video explaining what the module is about `online here
   <https://player.vimeo.com/video/426777950?autoplay=1>`__.

   Other people are welcome to make use of the
   material here. The authors welcome feedback and would particularly
   appreciate an `email <mailto:david.ham@imperial.ac.uk>`__ if this

   Weekly material
   ---------------

   The numerical analysis and implementation parts of the module run in
   parallel. Each has videos and exercises embedded in its notes. This table
   indicates the progress that you should make through each component each week.

   Part 1: Numerical analysis
   --------------------------

   The theory  part of
   the module will be led by `Prof. Colin Cotter
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`__. The material is presented
   by means of a set of lecture notes, with lecture videos interspersed in the
   notes. 

   The text for this part of the module is Brenner and Scott *The
   Mathematical Theory of Finite Element Methods*. Imperial College has
   fortunately paid for PDF access to this book, so it is accessible from
   the Imperial College network at `Springer Link
   <http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-75934-0>`__.

   However, this course has the material rearranged to synchronise the
   content better between the lecture notes and the implementation
   exercise.

   Past exam papers
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Please note that for 2015-2018, there was no mastery component in the
   examination, and so there were four questions. From 2019 on there are
   four questions plus one mastery question for 4th year/Masters credits.
   The topic of the Mastery question in 2024 will be the same as the topic
   of the Mastery question in 2021-23, i.e. finite element methods for
   Stokes equations. The topic was different in previous years.

    Part 2: Implementation
    ----------------------

    The implementation part of the module aims to give the students a
    deeper understanding of the finite element method through writing
    software to solve finite element problems in one and two dimensions.

    This part of the module will be taught by `Dr David Ham
    <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.ham>`__. The key to this part of the
    module is to build up a working finite element implementation over the course
    of the term, and thereby to gain a practical understanding of the method.

    The starting point for the implementation method is the skeleton code, an
    outline of a simple finite element library written in Python. Many of the
    critical algorithms in the skeleton code are left unimplemented, it will be
    your task to implement them over the course of the term.

    Each chapter of the implementation describes how a part of the finite element
    method is implemented. Along the way are videos which explain the text, or
    walk through the algorithms presented. Also interspersed in the text are
    exercises, typically requiring you to implement the algorithm just
    presented. We will look at how to do this in more detail presently.
