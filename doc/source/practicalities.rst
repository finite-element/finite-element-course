Practical matters
=================

Instructor
----------

The course is led by `Dr Jack S. Hale
<https://www.uni.lu/recherche/fstm/doe/members/jack_hale>`_.

Accreditation
-------------

This course is accredited within the Department of Mathematics Masters in
Mathematics for 5 ECTS. It is also available to doctoral candidates in the
Doctoral School in Science and Engineering. Doctoral candidates must undergo
the same assessment (exam and coursework) as the Masters candidates to receive
the 5 ECTS.

Assumed knowledge
-----------------

The theory component of the course will assume only a familiarity with
PDEs, vector calculus and basic undergraduate analysis. 

The implementation part of the course additionally assumes some ability to
program in a high level language (for example Python, Matlab, Java, C or C++).
The implementation language will be Python, a very high level and simple
language with similarities to MATLAB. Students who are not familiar with Python
will need to acquire some familiarity with the language, for example by doing
one of the suggested tutorials. 

The modern practice part of the course will build upon knowledge from
the theory and implementation part.

Assessment
----------

The theory part and modern practice part of the course will be
assessed by an exam worth 50% of the course. The implementation part
of the course will be assessed by submission of your working code
implementing finite element in two dimensions. This will also be worth
50%.

Submitting code for feedback
............................

The assessment of your finite element implementation will occur in a
single submission at the end of the semester. However feedback on your
progress will be available during the course. Informal feedback will
be available during the in person labs, and you will have the
opportunity to submit your code for formal feedback twice during the
semester, in weeks 7 and 13.

Moodle
------

Important announcements and the coursework submission will be
conducted via the University's moodle. Please ensure you are enrolled
in this course on Moodle!
