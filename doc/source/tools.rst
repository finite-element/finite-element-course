Software tools
==============

In order to do this module, you'll need some core software tools. As the module
proceeds we'll also install several more Python packages, but you don't need to
install those right now. The core tools you will need are:

    1. Python version 3.7 or later. Python 3.11 is recommended as the feedback
       that the interpreter provides if your code crashes has improved
       considerably.
    2. Git (the revision control system we're going to use).
    3. A Python-aware text editor. Visual Studio Code is recommended, and all
       the instructions in this course will assume that this is what you are using.

Links to installation instructions for all of these packages on a variety of
operating systems are available on the website of the textbook :doc:`Object-oriented
Programming in Python for Mathematicians <pop:installation>`.

Python 
......

Your implementation will be written in Python based on a code skeleton
provided. This means that you'll need a certain familiarity with the
Python language. But don't panic! Python is a very easy language to
work with. This module will use Python 3. 

If you haven't done any Python before, then go through `the official
Python tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`__. If
you have done a little Python but perhaps are not so familiar with the
object-oriented features such as classes, then you might like to refer to the
online book `Object-oriented Programming in Python for Mathematicians
<https://object-oriented-python.github.io>`__. We will be using classes
extensively in this course.

The Matlab-like array features of Python are provided by `Numpy
<https://www.numpy.org/>`__ for which there is a `helpful tutorial
<https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html>`__. There is also a
handy `guide for Matlab users
<https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`__. In that context, the
code provided in this course will always use Numpy arrays, and never
Numpy matrices.

Git
...

Version control is a mechanism for recording and managing different
versions of changing software. This enables changes to be tracked and
helps in the process of debugging code, and in managing conflicts when
more than one person is working on the same project. Revision control
can be combined with online hosting to provide secure backups and to
enable you to work on code from different locations.

In this module, you'll use verion control to access the skeleton
files, and to update those files if and when they change. You'll also
use the same revision control system to record the edits you make over
time and to submit your work for feedback and, eventually, marking.

We will be using the revision control system `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_,
which is the current state of the art and is widely adopted. We'll be combining
git with the online hosting service `GitHub <http://github.org>`_.

.. proof:exercise::

    Install Git and work through the :doc:`git appendix of Object-oriented
    Programming in Python for Mathematicians <pop:a2_git>`.

    Next, go and do the `git tutorial <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_
    over at Software Carpentry.

.. hint::

   If you are a more confident computer user, you could go ahead and
   set up git to work with ssh, the secure shell. This will save a lot
   of password typing but it's not essential so if you are not so
   confident with computers, you can skip this bit. GitHub provide
   `instructions for using ssh with git
   <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/>`__.


Visual Studio Code
..................

Visual Studio Code is a Python-aware Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
This means that it incorporates editing files with other programming features
such as :ref:`debugging`, Git support, and built-in :ref:`terminal
<terminal-vscode>`.

The command line
................

A lot of the routine activity involved in this module revolves around
executing commands on the command line. For example you use the
command line to work with the revision control system. 

.. proof:exercise:: 

    If you're not familiar with the Linux command line, then follow at least
    the first two sections of the `Software Carpentry Unix Shell lesson
    <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`__. That guide focusses on
    the Bash shell, but zsh and the Windows Powershell use very similar
    commands.
